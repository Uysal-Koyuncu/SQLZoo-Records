\\Order is random. Does not matter. Manual ordering solves it.



SELECT a.num, a.company, stopb.name, c.num, c.company
  FROM
    route a
    JOIN route b ON (a.company=b.company AND a.num=b.num)
    JOIN route c ON (b.stop=c.stop)
    JOIN route d ON (c.company=d.company AND c.num=d.num)
    JOIN stops stopa ON (a.stop=stopa.id)
    JOIN stops stopb ON (b.stop=stopb.id)
    JOIN stops stopc ON (c.stop=stopc.id)
    JOIN stops stopd ON (d.stop=stopd.id)
  WHERE stopa.name='Craiglockhart' AND stopd.name='Lochend'
